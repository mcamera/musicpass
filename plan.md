## Core Features & User Flows

### 1. Event Creation (Organizers)

**Flow:**
1. Organizer registers and verifies identity
2. Creates event with details (name, date, venue, pricing)
3. Sets royalty percentage for secondary sales
4. Mints initial ticket supply as NFTs
5. Publishes event to marketplace

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
async function createEvent(eventData: EventData) {
  // 1. Validate organizer credentials
  const organizer = await verifyOrganizer(eventData.organizerId);
  
  // 2. Create event record
  const event = await db.events.create(eventData);
  
  // 3. Deploy smart contract for event
  const contract = await deployEventContract(event);
  
  // 4. Mint initial tickets
  const tickets = await mintTickets(contract, eventData.initialSupply);
  
  return { event, contract, tickets };
}
```

### 2. Ticket Purchase (Fans)

**Flow:**
1. User browses available events
2. Selects desired tickets
3. Connects wallet and approves transaction
4. Receives NFT ticket in wallet
5. Gets confirmation and access to ticket details

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
async function purchaseTicket(eventId: string, quantity: number) {
  // 1. Check ticket availability
  const availability = await checkAvailability(eventId, quantity);
  
  // 2. Calculate total cost (including gas)
  const totalCost = calculateTotalCost(availability.price, quantity);
  
  // 3. Execute purchase transaction
  const tx = await contract.purchaseTickets(eventId, quantity, {
    value: totalCost
  });
  
  // 4. Wait for confirmation
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  
  // 5. Update database and notify user
  await updateTicketOwnership(receipt);
  
  return receipt;
}
```

### 3. Secondary Market Trading

**Flow:**
1. Ticket owner lists ticket for sale
2. Buyer finds listing and makes offer
3. Smart contract executes trade
4. Royalties automatically distributed
5. New owner receives ticket

**Technical Implementation:**
```solidity
function executeTrade(uint256 listingId) external payable {
    Listing storage listing = listings[listingId];
    require(msg.value >= listing.price, "Insufficient payment");
    
    // Transfer ticket
    _transfer(listing.seller, msg.sender, listing.tokenId);
    
    // Calculate and distribute royalties
    uint256 royaltyAmount = (listing.price * listing.royaltyPercentage) / 100;
    payable(listing.eventOrganizer).transfer(royaltyAmount);
    
    // Pay seller (minus royalties and platform fee)
    uint256 sellerAmount = listing.price - royaltyAmount - platformFee;
    payable(listing.seller).transfer(sellerAmount);
    
    // Pay platform fee
    payable(platformWallet).transfer(platformFee);
    
    delete listings[listingId];
    emit TradeExecuted(listingId, listing.seller, msg.sender, listing.price);
}
```

### 4. Event Check-in

**Flow:**
1. User opens app and displays ticket QR code
2. Event staff scans QR code with check-in app
3. System verifies ticket validity on blockchain
4. Ticket marked as used and user gains entry
5. POAP (Proof of Attendance) minted

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
async function checkInTicket(qrCodeData: string) {
  // 1. Decode QR code data
  const { ticketId, signature, timestamp } = decodeQRCode(qrCodeData);
  
  // 2. Verify signature and timestamp
  const isValid = await verifySignature(ticketId, signature, timestamp);
  
  // 3. Check ticket status on blockchain
  const ticketStatus = await contract.getTicketStatus(ticketId);
  
  // 4. Mark ticket as used
  if (isValid && !ticketStatus.isUsed) {
    await contract.markTicketUsed(ticketId);
    
    // 5. Mint POAP
    await mintPOAP(ticketId, ticketStatus.eventId);
    
    return { success: true, poapMinted: true };
  }
  
  return { success: false, error: "Invalid ticket" };
}
```
